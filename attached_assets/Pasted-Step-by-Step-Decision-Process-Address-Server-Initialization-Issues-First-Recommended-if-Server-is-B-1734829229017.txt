Step-by-Step Decision Process
Address Server Initialization Issues First (Recommended if Server is Blocking Progress)
If server initialization issues prevent the core application from running, they should be addressed first. The pipeline's goal is to ensure smooth integration and deployment, which relies on a working server.
Without a functional server, even if files are fixed, they canâ€™t be tested properly for integration.
Actions to Take:

Debug and resolve server issues as detailed earlier.
Restart the server and confirm it's operational:
npm run dev
Once the server is functional, proceed with batch processing for comprehensive review and fixing.
Start with a Smaller Scope Focusing on Specific File Types (Recommended if Server Issues are Minor)
If server issues are minor and not critical (e.g., logs show initialization but no fatal errors), you can focus on processing specific file types (e.g., .py and .js).
This allows incremental improvements without overloading the system.
Actions to Take:

Process files in smaller batches or by priority directories (e.g., src/, server/):
Python: Focus on backend logic.
JavaScript: Focus on client-side and integration components.
Batch size: Start with 5-10 files to avoid overwhelming the system.
Example:
# In the earlier script, modify the directory processing function:
def process_directory(directory, batch_size=5):
    files = [os.path.join(root, file) for root, _, files in os.walk(directory) for file in files]
    language_files = [file for file in files if detect_language(file)]

    for i in range(0, len(language_files), batch_size):
        batch = language_files[i:i + batch_size]
        print(f"Processing batch: {batch}")
        for file in batch:
            process_file(file)  # Handle individual files.
Implement the Batch Processing System Focusing on Specific Directories (Best for Larger Projects)
If server initialization issues are known or minimal, implement batch processing targeting directories critical to the core application (e.g., src/, api/).
This ensures high-impact files are reviewed and fixed first while maintaining a manageable load.
Actions to Take:

Prioritize key directories and batch process them:
Example:
Backend (server/): Process .py files.
Frontend (src/): Process .js or .ts files.
Adjust batch size based on directory size:
Smaller directories: Batch size = 5.
Larger directories: Batch size = 10-20.
Final Recommendation: Phased Approach
Address Server Initialization Issues First (if necessary):
Debug logs, database connection, and server startup as detailed earlier.
Focus on Smaller Scope for Core Application Files (first priority):
Process the most critical files (e.g., server/index.js or src/main.py) to unblock major components.
Adjust the batch size dynamically.
Implement Full Batch Processing for Comprehensive Review:
Target priority directories for a complete review.
