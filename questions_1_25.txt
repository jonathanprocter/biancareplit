Question 1 (Beginner; NCLEX Category: Pharmacological and Parenteral Therapies)
A new graduate nurse is caring for a patient who is prescribed a medication that is classified by its mechanism of action (e.g., a beta-blocker). To ensure correct understanding of drug classification, which approach best reflects applying this concept in clinical practice?
A. Identifying the drug solely by the patient's reported symptoms.
B. Understanding that a drug classified by its pharmacologic action (like beta-blockade) will guide the nurse in anticipating its effects (e.g., reducing heart rate) and necessary assessments.
C. Administering the drug without reviewing its mechanism of action since the provider ordered it.
D. Choosing the drug based on the patient's favorite pill color.
Correct Answer: B
Rationale: Pharmacologic classification describes the drug by its mechanism of action, aiding the nurse in anticipating therapeutic effects, side effects, and required patient monitoring. This helps ensure safe and targeted patient care.
