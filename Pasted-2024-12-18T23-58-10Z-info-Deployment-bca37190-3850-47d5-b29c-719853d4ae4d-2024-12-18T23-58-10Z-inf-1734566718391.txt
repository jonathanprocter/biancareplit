npm warn skipping integrity check for git dependency ssh://git@github.com/dmarcos/three-bmfont-text.git

npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.

npm warn deprecated @types/date-fns@2.6.3: This is a stub types definition. date-fns provides its own type definitions, so you do not need this installed.

npm warn deprecated @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties@7.18.6: This proposal has been merged to the ECMAScript standard and thus this plugin is no longer maintained. Please use @babel/plugin-transform-class-properties instead.
