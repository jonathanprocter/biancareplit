[ADVANCED LEVEL QUESTIONS (51-75)]

Question 51 (Advanced; NCLEX Category: Pharmacological and Parenteral Therapies)
A patient's medication profile includes a drug extensively metabolized by CYP450 enzymes. Genetic testing suggests the patient is a poor metabolizer. How should the nurse integrate this complex information to enhance medication safety and efficacy?
A. Proceed with the standard dose without adjustments.
B. Collaborate with the provider and pharmacist to consider dose reduction or an alternative medication less affected by CYP450 variants, and closely monitor therapeutic response and side effects.
C. Encourage the patient to take extra doses for effectiveness.
D. Disregard genetic testing results.
Correct Answer: B
Rationale: Advanced practice involves using pharmacogenomic data to personalize treatment. Adjusting therapy based on metabolic status prevents toxicity and subtherapeutic outcomes, reflecting a high level of clinical reasoning.
