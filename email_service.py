1. Syntax errors and bugs:
    - There are no syntax errors in the code. However, the SMTP port validation should be done before checking if the required settings are missing. If the SMTP port is not valid, it should be added to the missing settings list.
    - The EmailService class is designed as a singleton but lacks a class variable to hold the instance. Add `_instance = None` at the class level.
    - The `email` parameter is not validated properly. It will allow invalid email addresses. Use a regular expression or a library like `validate_email` to ensure the input is a valid email address.

2. Security vulnerabilities:
    - SMTP password is fetched from the environment variable in plaintext. It should be encrypted and decrypted during use. 

3. Performance issues:
    - Not applicable.

4. Integration problems:
    - Not applicable.

5. Code style and best practices:
    - Code is well-structured and follows PEP-8 style guide.
    - Use f-strings instead of string concatenation.
    - Use logging module instead of print statements for logging errors and information.

Specific fixes:

```python
from validate_email import validate_email

class EmailService:
    _instance = None
    # Rest of the class...

    def __init__(self):
        if self._initialized:
            return

        try:
            # Rest of the code...
            
            # Validate port number with proper type handling
            try:
                if smtp_port is None:
                    self.smtp_port = 587  # Default to 587 if not set
                else:
                    port_value = int(smtp_port)
                    if not (0 <= port_value <= 65535):
                        raise ValueError(f"Invalid SMTP port number: {port_value}")
                    else:
                        self.smtp_port = port_value
            except (TypeError, ValueError) as e:
                missing_settings.append("SMTP_PORT")
                
            # Rest of the code...
            

    def send_daily_summary(
        self, email: str, summary_data: Dict[str, Any]
    ) -> tuple[bool, str]:
        """
        Send a daily study summary email to the specified address.
        Returns a tuple of (success: bool, message: str)
        """
        try:
            if not email or not validate_email(email):
                return (False, "Invalid email address")

            # Rest of the code...
```

For the SMTP password, consider using a secure method to store it, such as AWS Secrets Manager, Hashicorp Vault, or some other secure tool your organization may already be using.
