[INTERMEDIATE LEVEL QUESTIONS (26-50)]

Question 26 (Intermediate; NCLEX Category: Pharmacological and Parenteral Therapies)
A patient is prescribed a medication metabolized predominantly by the liver. The nurse notes that the patient's liver function tests are borderline abnormal. Applying an analytical approach, which action best demonstrates safe and effective nursing care?
A. Administer the full prescribed dose without consulting anyone.
B. Collaborate with the provider to consider a dose adjustment or alternative drug, and monitor closely for signs of toxicity, given the reduced metabolic capacity.
C. Assume the patient's liver will adapt over time.
D. Withhold all medications that require metabolism, regardless of patient need.
Correct Answer: B
Rationale: Higher-level thinking involves recognizing how impaired liver function can alter drug metabolism, leading to toxicity. By collaborating with the provider and monitoring closely, the nurse ensures safer, patient-centered care.
